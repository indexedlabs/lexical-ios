This is O(n log n) and looks like a likely hot cost for large docs.\n  - The optimized reconciler invalidates this cache in multiple fast paths even when structure does not change (e.g. text-only / prepost-only paths), which may be avoidable.\n\n- Read-only vs live editor behavior:\n  - fastPath_InsertBlock is explicitly disabled for LexicalReadOnlyTextKitContext (OptimizedReconciler.swift) to preserve parity. This means benchmark tests built on read-only contexts will *not* exercise structural insert fast path performance.\n\n- Bug discovered while wiring perf tests:\n  - computePartDiffs previously ignored inserted nodes missing from the prev range cache, which could make 'prepost-gated-noop' incorrectly early-out on real structural inserts. Fixed in Lexical/Helper/PlanDiff.swift.\n\nNext steps to investigate:\n- Reduce cachedDFSOrder invalidations (only invalidate on structural changes) and measure impact on new MixedDocumentBenchmarkTests.\n- Consider replacing rebuildLocationsWithFenwickRanges usages with diff-array variant (rebuildLocationsWithRangeDiffs) where applicable.\n- Consider caching/reusing the indexOf map alongside cachedDFSOrder to avoid rebuilding the dictionary each update.\n- Add a LexicalView-backed perf test harness to measure real editor path (where structural insert fast path is enabled).","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-16T15:50:06.956742-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T16:23:16.733308-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"lexical-ios-u7r.5","depends_on_id":"lexical-ios-u7r","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-16T15:50:06.957089-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
